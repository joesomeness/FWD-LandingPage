# FWD-LandingPage
## By Youssef Radwan
This project uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic "Navigation Menu", scroll to corresponding elements when
clicked in the "Navigation Menu", and highlight the section that is visible in the viewport.

In case of adding a new element to the HTML document, please use the same classes, IDs, and attributes that were used on the other elements.
